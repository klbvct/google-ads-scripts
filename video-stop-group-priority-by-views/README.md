# Google Ads Script - video-stop-group-priority-by-views
This script retrieves all active video campaigns in Google Ads and collects statistics for active ad groups for the current month, summing the number of views for ad groups with the same name. Each ad group can have a priority label: P1, P2, or P3. If the total number of views for a group with the P1 label exceeds 10,000, with the P2 label exceeds 7,000, or with the P3 label exceeds 2,500, all groups with that name are automatically paused. The script logs the total view metrics for each group and pauses groups that exceed the threshold if necessary.
